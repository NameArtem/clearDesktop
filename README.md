# clearDesktop
This code saves your desktop clear. All banned files are moved to user/Trash and they are removed every friday. (Idea was created for save student's desktop clear)

notBanned    - value creates list of files which can exist on the desktop
workDir      - value creates folder where is the desktop
studentTrash - value creates folder where are trashes from desktop
vm           - value creates folderwhere are virtual boxes (it's only for me because I want to clear this folder with Virtual Machines)
allDelFiles  - valuer creates list of removed files

My code has only 2 simple function.
